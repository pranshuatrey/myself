    <!--The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with 
JavaScript.

If div tag was empty then it will have 0 heght but as here we have added h1 and p tag thus it will have some 
height

Due to some default css applied on body tag we see that there is some distance between our border of website
and content, so to renove this distance we have to override sone default values.Also some default values 
in heading tag should also be overriden.  

Also revise the concept of bssic box model of css from mdn to truly uvderstand this topic


*************************  THE  BOX  MODEL  IN   CSS**********************
Every single html element is treated as box by css, which is further styled by css.

For an html element we have content area as box which is where we write all content of our website in body.
After that we have padding area which is space betweeb content and border and after that comes border area
and at the end margin area which is apace between two html elements.



Here we have to override margin property value to zero to have no space between website border and div..-->

    <!--Display property in css specifies the display behaaviour of an element. Its values csn be:
1.  Block : it make  element to always starts on a new line. A block-level element always takes up the full
    width of  webpage. For example: <p>, <form>, list and list items, heading, <div> etc

2.  Inline: It makes element to does not start on a new line. An inline element only takes up as much width as
    required. For example: img, a, span.
    
3.  Inline-block : By this value we can make elements as inline but main thing is we can also change the
    width of element.

4.  None:  This will help us to get rid of elements, means it will display nothing.

we van also use visibility hidden to make same changes but in this case positioning will remainn there.-->

    <!--The <span> is inline element used to mark up a part of a text, or part of a document
        or part of block elements.
    
    NOW after reading this very obvious question should arise in your mind? Then why we use block elements if 
    we have  inline elements?
THE REASON IS WE CANNOT CHANGE THE WIDTH OF INLINE ELEMENTS WHEREAS CHANGING WIDTH IS PPOSSIBLE IN BLOCK
ELEMENTS , thats why we use them.

Solution for this is, we can use display property for such elements with inline-block value which will make 
element to change its width and also to act as inline element.-->

    <!--**********************  POSITION PROPERTY IN CSS  *******************-->
    <!-- The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document.
The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine the final location of positioned elements

********* VALUES OF POSITION PROPERTY *********

position: static;
The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. The top, right, bottom, left, and 
z-index properties have no effect. This is the default value. Means elements will be positioned as they were
positioned by default by default css applied to them.

position: relative;
In this element will move away from its initial position, to that value specified. This does not affect the 
position of any other element.
It will not effect the flow of element menas after repositioning of element still ghost element is present 
at its initial position so it is not deleted so other element will not take its place.

position: absolute;
It effects the flow of element as after repositioning the, initial position of element is deleted thus other
elements take its place. It also does not affect the position of other elements.
In this element is positioned relative to its parent element, in most of cases it is body but sometime it can 
be any other element.



position: fixed;
It also effect the flow of html as its initial position is deleted hence other element can take its place.
Also it does not effect the positon of other element.
This make our element fixed at place specified, even if we are scrolling our page it will stay on that position
meams it will be visible on screen even if we are scrolling our page.

position: sticky;

/* Global values */
position: inherit;
position: initial;
position: revert;
position: unset;-->

    <!--Most important decision i have to make as a developer is what font i am gonna use in my website.
Now what happen is if for some reason font that we are using in our website is not installed in user 
browser or operaring system  then by default it will show that type of sans serif font that is installed in
that browser or operating system, this can make our website look different for different users so to avoid
this we use web safe fonts. -->

    <!--                 ************** WEB SAFE FONTS ***************
Web safe fonts are fonts that are universally installed across all browsers and devices.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> NO FONT IS 100% WEB SAFE <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<-->
    <!--That is why we use fallback fonts which are backup fonts which will apperar to user if first font is not
installed in their browser and if second is also not installed then third will show and so on. -->
